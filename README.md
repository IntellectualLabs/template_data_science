# Data Science Template

This is a starter template for data science projects in Intellectual Labs.

As it is impossible to create a single template that will meet every projects needs,
this example should be considered
a starting point and changed based upon the working and evolution of your project.

This template builds upon the [data science template provided by Equinor](https://github.com/equinor/data-science-template), which in turn builds on a [Cookiecutter template](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).

(For the precommit hooks used in this template see: `precommit.md`.)

## Getting Started With This Template

This template is provided as a [Cookiecutter template](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) so you
can quickly create an instance customised for your project. An assumption is that you have a working python installation.

To get running, first install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

```bash
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

### Create project

Then generate a new project for your own use based upon the template, answering the questions to customise the generated project:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/IntellectualLabs/data_science_template
```

The values you are prompted for are:

| Value                  | Description                                                         |
| :--------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| project_name           | A name for your project. Used mostly within documentation           |
| project_description    | A description to include in the README.md                           |
| repo_name              | The name of the github repository where the project will be held    |
| package_name           | A name for the generated python package.                            |
| author                 | The main author of the solution. Included in the setup.py file      |
| python_package_manager | Which Python package manager to use ("conda" or "poetry")           |
| open_source_license    | What type of open source license the project will be released under |

If you are uncertain about what to enter for any value then just accept the defaults.
You can always change the generated project later.

You are now ready to get started, however you should first create a new
github repository for your new project and add your project using the following commands
(substitute `myproject` with the name of your project and REMOTE-REPOSITORY-URL
with the remote repository url).

```bash
cd myproject
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin REMOTE-REPOSITORY-URL
git remote -v
git push origin master
```

Finally update the project readme file, `README.md`, with additional project specific details
including setup, configuration and usage.

## Generated Project Contents

Depending upon the selected options when creating the project, the generated structure will look similar to the below:

```
